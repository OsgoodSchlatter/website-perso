              Nuclear energy lies within the energy of the bounds between the
              components of the nucleus. This nucleus is made of{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">protons</span>, (electrically
              positively charged) and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">neutrons</span> (without charge). The
              protons, since they have the same charge, repel each other like
              two same poles of two magnets would do. The neutrons are there to
              maintain the whole structure.

              , with a lot of protons and neutrons inside the nucleus, the
              mutual repellency of all the protons can make it go unstable and
              break into two lighter nucleus and release energy at the same
              time. That is what we call{" "}

              merge together and form a bigger and more stabler atom, while also
              releasing energy. That is what we call{" "}

              <span className="font-bold">Joule (J) </span>. The energy is what
              can make systems change their state. To move a car from point A to
              point B, you need energy. Roughly, a joule of energy is equal to
              the amount of work done when a force of 1 Newton moves a mass
              through a distance of 1 meter. It can also be written in{" "}

              379,5 TWh of electrical energy is produced by nuclear plants.

              <span className="font-bold">Power: </span> measured in{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">Watt (W)</span>. The power is derived
              from the energy by dividing it by unit of time. It is the amount
              of energy transferred by time. I.E. it takes that many J to climb
              up the Eiffel Tower in an hour, but what if I want to go twice as
              fast ? then you're talking about power.
