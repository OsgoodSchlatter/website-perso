              point B, you need energy. Roughly, a joule of energy is equal to
              the amount of work done when a force of 1 Newton moves a mass
              through a distance of 1 meter. It can also be written in{" "}

              It is possible to calculate the mass of a single neutron or a
              single proton, and also the mass of an nucleus. But, when doing
              the computation, we find that the mass of the{" "}
              <Latex>{"$Z$"}</Latex> protons + the mass of
              <Latex>{" $A-Z$"}</Latex> neutrons does not match the total mass
              of the nucleus. Einstein's famous equation{" "}
              <Latex>{"$E=mc^2$"}</Latex> solves this problem of missing mass:
              the mass left is under the form of energy, binding the nucleons
              together. This energy, if provided, can break apart the nucleus
              into its nucleons.
